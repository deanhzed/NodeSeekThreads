# NodeSeek Threads

A user script that enhances the [NodeSeek](https://www.nodeseek.com/) comment section by introducing nested (threaded) comments, making conversations easier to follow.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Nested Comments**: Automatically nests replies under their parent comments, creating a clear conversation tree.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Uses colored left borders to indicate nesting depth, making it easy to track conversations.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to both desktop and mobile views for a great reading experience on any screen size.
- **Theme Compatibility**: Supports both Light and Dark modes of the NodeSeek website, with automatic border color switching.
- **Clear Indicators**: Adds a "Floor" label next to the username to clearly mark nested replies.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  You need a user script manager, such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
2.  Once the manager is installed, you can install the script in one of two ways:
    - **Install from Greasy Fork**: [Click here to install](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/your-script-id) (You will need to replace this link after publishing your script).
    - **Install from file**: Drag and drop the `nodeseek_nested_comments_v26_no_header_merge.user.js` file into your browser's extensions management page.
